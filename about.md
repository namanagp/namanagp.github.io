# About Me

I am a Business Analyst with a strong foundation in data analytics, machine learning, and business decision-making.

Currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics, I have worked on projects involving enterprise data modeling, predictive modeling, optimization, and analytics dashboards.

I enjoy solving ambiguous problems, improving processes with data, and translating technical insights into business-friendly recommendations.
